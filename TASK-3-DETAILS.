2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
3. Remove Missing Values: Ensure no crucial data is missing that could skew the analysis.
4.Handle Duplicates: Eliminate any repeated entries to maintain data integrity.
5.Standardize Data: Ensure consistent formats for variables such as movie titles, genres, and ratings.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1.Identify Key Variables: Focus on factors like genres, directors, release years, ratings, and viewer counts.
2.Correlation Analysis: Use statistical methods to find correlations between these factors and viewership or ratings.
3.Distribution Analysis: Understand the distribution of movies and TV shows across different genres and years.
4.Data Visualization

Power BI and Tableau Dashboards: Create interactive dashboards to display MYfindings.
