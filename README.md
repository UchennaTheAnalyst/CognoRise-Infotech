### REQUIREMENTS OF COVID 19 DATASET
The data is related to the emergence and spread of the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, using Power BI and Tableau. I analysed the progression of cases, the pattern of human-to-human transmission, and the escalation in transmission rates observed around mid-January 2020. I visualized the confirmed case count and other relevant metrics to gain insights into the virus's impact and spread dynamics
